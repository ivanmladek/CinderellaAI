        CINDERELLA


        Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the
        proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former
        husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like
        her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,
        but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took
        from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.

        No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law
        began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good
        qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own
        daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work
        of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam’s
        chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry
        garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms,
        with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where
        they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at
        their full length from head to foot.

        The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who
        would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she
        had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down
        among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench;
        but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called
        her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel,
        was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always
        dressed very richly.

        It happened that the King’s son gave a ball, and invited all persons of
        fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very
        grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this
        invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats,
        and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to
        Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters’ linen, and plaited
        their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should
        be dressed.

        “For my part,” said the eldest, “I will wear my red velvet suit with
        French trimming.”

        “And I,” said the youngest, “shall have my usual petticoat; but then,
        to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my
        diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the
        world.”

        They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their
        head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red
        brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.

        Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these
        matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the
        best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they
        were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to
        her:

        “Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?”

        “Alas!” said she, “you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go
        thither.”

        “Thou art in the right of it,” replied they; “it would make the people
        laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.”

        Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was
        very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days
        without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above
        a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a
        fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.
        At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed
        them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of
        them, she fell a-crying.

        Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.

        “I wish I could--I wish I could--“; she was not able to speak the rest,
        being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.

        This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, “Thou wishest thou
        couldst go to the ball; is it not so?”

        “Y--es,” cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.

        “Well,” said her godmother, “be but a good girl, and I will contrive
        that thou shalt go.” Then she took her into her chamber, and said to
        her, “Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.”

        Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and
        brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin
        could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside
        of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with
        her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded
        all over with gold.

        She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all
        alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when,
        giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse
        was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very
        fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being
        at a loss for a coachman,

        “I will go and see,” says Cinderella, “if there is never a rat in the
        rat-trap--we may make a coachman of him.”

        “Thou art in the right,” replied her godmother; “go and look.”

        Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge
        rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest
        beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat,
        jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After
        that, she said to her:

        “Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the
        watering-pot, bring them to me.”

        She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six
        footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their
        liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind
        each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy
        then said to Cinderella:

        “Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not
        pleased with it?”

        “Oh! yes,” cried she; “but must I go thither as I am, in these nasty
        rags?”

        Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same
        instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all
        beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the
        prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her
        coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay
        till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed
        one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice,
        her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as
        they were before.

        She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before
        midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for
        joy. The King’s son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody
        knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she
        alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the
        company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off
        dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to
        contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was
        then heard but a confused noise of:

        “Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!”

        The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and
        telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so
        beautiful and lovely a creature.

        All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress,
        that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided
        they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.

        The King’s son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward
        took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they
        all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof
        the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing
        on her.

        She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand
        civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince
        had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not
        know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the
        clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a
        courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.

        When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having
        thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next
        day to the ball, because the King’s son had desired her.

        As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the
        ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and
        opened.

        “How long you have stayed!” cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and
        stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she
        had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went
        from home.

        “If thou hadst been at the ball,” said one of her sisters, “thou wouldst
        not have been tired with it. There came thither the finest princess, the
        most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand
        civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.”

        Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them
        the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and
        that the King’s son was very uneasy on her account and would give all
        the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:

        “She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been!
        Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow
        suit of clothes which you wear every day.”

        “Ay, to be sure!” cried Miss Charlotte; “lend my clothes to such a dirty
        Cinderwench as thou art! I should be a fool.”

        Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the
        refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent
        her what she asked for jestingly.

        The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella,
        but dressed more magnificently than before. The King’s son was always by
        her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom
        all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
        godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the
        clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she
        then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but
        could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which
        the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath,
        and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery
        but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards
        at the palace gate were asked:

        If they had not seen a princess go out.

        Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly
        dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a
        gentlewoman.

        When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If
        they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.

        They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck
        twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass
        slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King’s son had taken up;
        that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and
        that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person
        who owned the glass slipper.

        What they said was very true; for a few days after the King’s son caused
        it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose
        foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it
        upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain;
        it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could
        to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.
        Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them,
        laughing:

        “Let me see if it will not fit me.”

        Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman
        who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and,
        finding her very handsome, said:

        It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let
        everyone make trial.

        He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot,
        he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made
        of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great,
        but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket
        the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her
        godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella’s clothes, made
        them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.

        And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom
        they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg
        pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella
        took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:

        That she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to
        love her.

        She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought
        her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.
        Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters
        lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two
        great lords of the Court.

LITTLE SNOW WHITE

It was in the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, 
that a certain queen sat working at her window, the frame of which was made of fine black ebony;
 and, as she was looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it.
 Then she gazed thoughtfully down on the red drops which sprinkled the white snow and said,
 "Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as the blood, and as
 black as the ebony window-frame!" And so the little girl grew up; her skin was a white as snow,
 her cheeks as rosy as blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snow-White.

But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who was very beautiful, but so
 proud that she could not bear to think that any one could surpass her. She had a magical looking-glass,
 to which she used to go and gaze upon herself in it, and say—

"Tell me, glass, tell me true!
Of all the ladies in the land,
Who is fairest? tell me who?"
And the glass answered, "Thou, Queen, art fairest in the land"

But Snow-White grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old, she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered queen, when she went to consult it as usual—

"Thou, Queen, may'st fair and beauteous be,
But Snow-White is lovelier far than thee?"

When the queen heard this she turned pale with rage and envy; and calling to one of her servants said,
 "Take Snow-White away into the wide wood, that I may never see her more." Then the servant led the little girl
 away; but his heart melted when she begged him to spare her life, and he said, "I will not hurt thee, thou pretty child."
 So he left her there alone; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her to pieces,
 he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her, but leave her to her fate.

Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared around, but none did her any harm.
In the evening she came to a little cottage, and went in there to rest, for her weary feet would carry her no further.
Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates with seven little loaves and seven little glasses with wine in them; and knives and forks laid in order, and by the wall stood seven little beds.
Then, as she was exceedingly hungry, she picked a little piece off each loaf, and drank a very little wine out of each glass;
 and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; and one was too long,
and another was too short, till, at last, the seventh suited her; and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.
Presently in came the masters of the cottage, who were seven little dwarfs that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched about for gold.
 They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw directly that all was not right. The first said, "Who has been sitting on my stool?"
The second, "Who has been eating off my plate?" The third, "Who has been picking at my bread?"
The fourth, "Who has been meddling with my spoon?" The fifth, "Who has been handling my fork?"
The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?" The seventh, "Who has been drinking my wine?"
Then the first looked around and said, "Who has been lying on my bed?" And the rest came running to him,
and every one cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snow-White, and called
upon his brethren to come and look at her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment,
and brought their lamps and gazing upon her, they said, "Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!"
And they were delighted to see her, and took care not to waken her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour
with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.

In the morning Snow-White told them all her story, and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order,
 and cook and wash, and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her.
Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home;
 and they warned her, saying, "The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in."
But the queen, now that she thought Snow-White was dead, believed that she was certainly the handsomest lady in the land;
 so she went to her glass and said—

"Tell me, glass, tell me true!
Of all the ladies in the land,
Who is fairest? tell me who?"
And the glass answered—
"Thou, Queen, thou are fairest in all this land;
But over the Hills, in the greenwood shade,
Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,
There Snow-White is hiding; and she
Is lovelier far, O Queen, than thee."

Then the queen was very much alarmed; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and she was sure that the servant 
had betrayed her.
 And as she could not bear to think that any one lived who was more beautiful than she was, she disguised herself as an old pedlar woman
and went her way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door and cried,
"Fine wares to sell!" Snow-White looked out of the window, and said, "Good day, good woman; what have you to sell?"
 "Good wares, fine wares," replied she; "laces and bobbins of all colors." "I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very 
good sort of a body," thought Snow-White; so she ran down, and unbolted the door.
 "Bless me!" said the woman, "how badly your stays are laced. Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces."
 Snow-White did not dream of any mischief; so she stood up before the old woman who set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tightly that Snow-White lost her breath, and fell down as if she were dead.
"There's an end of all thy beauty," said the spiteful queen, and went away home.

In the evening the seven dwarfs returned; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snow-White stretched upon the ground motionless, as if she were quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what was the matter, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and soon came to herself again. Then they said, "The old woman was the queen; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away."

When the queen got home, she went to her glass, and spoke to it, but to her surprise it replied in the same words as before.

Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to hear that Snow-White still lived; and she dressed herself up again in a disguise,
 but very different from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the
 door, and cried, "Fine wares to sell!" but Snow-White said, "I dare not let any one in." Then the queen said,
"Only look at my beautiful combs;" and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty that the little girl took it up and
 put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.
 "There you may lie," said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs returned very early that evening;
 and when they saw Snow-White lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb.
And when they took it away, she recovered, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to any one.

Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and trembled with rage when she received exactly the same answer as before; and she said,
 "Snow-White shall die, if it costs me my life." So she went secretly into a chamber, and prepared a poisoned apple:
 the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whosoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and
 travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-White put her head out of the window, and said,
 "I dare not let any one in, for the dwarfs have told me not to." "Do as you please," said the old woman,
 "but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will make you a present of it." "No," said Snow-White, "I dare not take it." "You silly girl!"
 answered the other, "what are you afraid of? do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other."
 Now the apple was so prepared that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-White was very much tempted to taste,
 for the apple looked exceedingly nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could refrain no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece
into her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground. "This time nothing will save thee," said the queen; and she went home to her glass,
 and at last it said—"Thou, Queen, art the fairest of all the fair." And then her envious heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.

When evening came, and the dwarfs returned home, they found Snow-White lying on the ground; no breath passed her lips, and they were afraid that
 she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain.
 So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they proposed to bury her;
 but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said,
"We will never bury her in the cold ground." And they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her,
and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. Then the coffin was placed upon the hill, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came, too, and bemoaned Snow-White. First of all came an owl, and then a raven, but at last came a dove.

And thus Snow-White lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as white as snow,
 and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw Snow-White and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly prayed them to let him take her away; but they said,
 "We will not part with her for all the gold in the world." At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and exclaimed,
 "Where am I!" And the prince answered, "Thou art safe with me." Then he told her all that had happened, and said,
 "I love you better than all the world; come with me to my father's palace, and you shall be my wife." Snow-White consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was prepared with great pomp and splendor for their wedding.

To the feast was invited, among the rest, Snow-White's old enemy, the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine,
 rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said, "Tell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest? tell me who?"
And the glass answered, "Thou, lady, art the loveliest here, I ween; But lovelier far is the new-made queen."

When she heard this, the queen started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.
 And when she arrived, and saw that it was no other than Snow-White, whom she thought had been dead a long while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died; but Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land, many, many years.

RAPUNZEL

There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
 These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress,
 who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden,
 when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’
‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.’ The man, who loved her,
thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’
 At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.

 She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three
 times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he
 let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. ‘How can
 you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’
 ‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the
 window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be
 softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one
 condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a
 mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child
 the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay
 in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed
herself beneath it and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,
 wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so
 charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.
The king’s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing
had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.
Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, 
I too will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s 
son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest,
and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband,
and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said yes,
and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down.
Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will
 take me on your horse.’ They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.
The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier
for me to draw up than the young king’s son—he is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.
‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!’
In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right,
 and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she
took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.

On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off,
 to the hook of the window, and when the king’s son came and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with
 wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
 the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.’
The king’s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life,
but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries,
and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length
came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.
He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck
and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.
He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.

SLEEPING BEAUTY

In times past there lived a king and queen, who said to each other every day of their lives, "Would that we had a child!" and yet they had none.
 But it happened once that when the queen was bathing, there came a frog out of the water, and he squatted on the ground, and said to her,


"Thy wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, thou shalt bring a daughter into the world."

And as the frog foretold, so it happened; and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he
 ordained a great feast. Not only did he bid to it his relations, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be kind
 and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from,
 one of them had to be left out. However, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to an end, the wise women stood forward to
 present to the child their wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so on, whatever there is in the world to wish
 for. And when eleven of them had said their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, burning to revenge herself, and without greeting or respect,
 she cried with a loud voice,

"In the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with a spindle and shall fall down dead."

And without speaking one more word she turned away and left the hall. Every one was terrified at her saying, when the twelfth came forward,
 for she had not yet bestowed her gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she could soften it, so she said,


"The princess shall not die, but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years."

Now the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt
 up.

The maiden grew up, adorned with all the gifts of the wise women; and she was so lovely, modest, sweet, and kind and clever, that no one who saw
 her could help loving her.

It happened one day, she being already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle.
 She wandered about into all the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the fancy took her, till at last she came to
 an old tower. She climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key sticking out of the lock; she turned the key,
 and the door opened, and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently spinning her flax.

"Good day, mother," said the princess, "what are you doing?"

"I am spinning," answered the old woman, nodding her head.

"What thing is that that twists round so briskly?" asked the maiden, and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had
 she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. In that very moment she fell back upon the bed that
 stood there, and lay in a deep sleep. And this sleep fell upon the whole castle; the king and queen, who had returned and were in the great hall,
 fell fast asleep, and with them the whole court. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the
 wall, the very fire that flickered on the hearth, became still, and slept like the rest; and the meat on the spit ceased roasting,
 and the cook, who was going to pull the scullion's hair for some mistake he had made, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind ceased,
 and not a leaf fell from the trees about the castle.

Then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker every year, until at last the whole castle was hidden from view,
 and nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof. And a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping Rosamond,
 for so was the princess called; and from time to time many kings' sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge;
 but it was impossible for them to do so, for the thorns held fast together like strong hands, and the young men were caught by them,
 and not being able to get free, there died a lamentable death.

Many a long year afterwards there came a king's son into that country, and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing
 behind the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named Rosamond had slept for a hundred years, and with her the king and
 queen, and the whole court. The old man had been told by his grandfather that many king's sons had sought to pass the thorn-hedge,
 but had been caught and pierced by the thorns, and had died a miserable death. Then said the young man, "Nevertheless,
I do not fear to try; I shall win through and see the lovely Rosamond." The good old man tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words.

For now the hundred years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns,
 it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge.
 When he reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their
 heads under their wings. And when he came indoors, the flies on the wall were asleep, the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the
 scullion, and the kitchen-maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to pluck. Then he mounted higher, and saw in the hall the whole court lying
 asleep, and above them, on their thrones, slept the king and the queen. And still he went farther, and all was so quiet that he could hear his
 own breathing; and at last he came to the tower, and went up the winding stair, and opened the door of the little room where Rosamond lay.
 And when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her, and she awaked,
 and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and whole court waked
 up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the hounds sprang up and
 wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the field, the flies on the wall
 crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to roast, the cook gave the
 scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl.

Then the wedding of the Prince and Rosamond was held with all splendour, and they lived very happily together until their lives' end.
